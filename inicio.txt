Generate SSH keys
The process is the same for both Windows and Mac. On Windows, you can use the Git Bash terminal and on Mac, the standard terminal will work.

Open the terminal

Enter the following:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"

Replace the email with your own and press enter.

It will prompt to enter a password. Hit enter to skip setting a password and do the same for entering the same passphrase again.

Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in ./ssh/private_key.
Your public key has been saved in ./ssh/public_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:UDQI5N1FL3QSq7Gj1o12mkr9Me7qGMZAeE1s9BWIln4 your@email.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|   .o+o=+oOo.    |
|   o +B+.= =     |
|  . +++ + o .    |
|   o  ..E+ .     |
|    .  .S        |
|     o + +       |
|      B = =      |
|     + + * o     |
|      oo=o+      |
+----[SHA256]-----+

Once you have confirmed it will generate the above to confirm the keys have been created.

Both keys will be stored in the .ssh folder.

In order to add our key to Github, we need to get a copy of the public key which is always identified as .pub in your local directory.

Find the name of the key file using the below command.
ls ~/.ssh/
Then, use the below command to copy the file, replacing the <YOUR KEY> with the name of the key file on your device.
Adding Your Keys to Github
We now need to add our public key to Github to grant access to the repositories we create.

Step 1: Log on to Github

Step 2: Click on the profile icon in the top right of the screen and select Settings.

Step 3: On the Settings screen, on the left-hand side under the Access section, click SSH and GPG Keys

Step 4: Click the New SSH key button in Green on the right-hand side of the screen.

Step 6: Click the Add SSH key button.

You are now ready to access Github via SSH.

Accessing Repositories
When accessing a repository and using SSH authentication, make sure to always use the SSH address of the repository.
